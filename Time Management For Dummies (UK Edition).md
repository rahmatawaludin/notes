========
Too busy to read heaps of information about time management? Help is at hand with this concise and useful Cheat Sheet, which gives you essential but easy time-saving tips.

## Top Time Management Tips
Help yourself to save time, and also to make the most of your time, by taking on board these tried-and-tested time management tips. If it’s too overwhelming to adopt all of them, pick one to try at first.

* **Spend a moment to plan each and every day.** Take a few minutes to jot down the few key things you need to achieve today.

* **Set a time limit.** You’re more focused and less likely to get distracted if you don’t have an open-ended time slot in your day for a particular task.

* **Write everything down.** You’ll save time and be less stressed if you’re not holding all those things you’re trying to remember in your head.

* **Focus on important tasks.** Don’t just focus on the urgent items.

* **Look at your longer-term goals.** Ask yourself how what you’re doing each day fits in with your goals.

* **Do little and often.** Breaking tasks into chunks helps to prevent a build-up and is less overwhelming when you’re only spending a few minutes on a task.

* **Take a break.** Doing so might seem counter-intuitive, but if you try to cram too much into your day you end up stressed out and exhausted. Have regular breaks and you’ll be more productive.

* **Don’t do it all on your own.** Don’t hesitate to ask for help when you need it.

* **Keep the balance.** Try not to spend all your waking hours at work – make time for home, family, and friends, and make sure you leave time to eat properly and exercise regularly.

Choose one of these procrastination-busting tips:
