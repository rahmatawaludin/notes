The Lean Startup Principles
------
1. **Enterpereneurs are everywhere.** They are people who work at human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty

2. **Entrepreneurship is management.** A startup is an institution, not just a product, and so it requires a new kind of management specifically geared to its context of extreme uncertainty.

3. **Validated learning.** Startups exist not just to make stuff, make money, or even serve customers. They exist to learn how to build a sustainable business.

4. **Build-Measure-Learn.** The fundamental activity of a startup is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere. 

5. **Innovation accounting.** To improve entrepreneurial outcomes and hold innovators accountable, we need to focus on the boring stuff: how to measure progress, how to set up milestones, and how to prioritize work. This requires a new kind of accounting designed for startupsâ€”and the people who hold them accountable.
